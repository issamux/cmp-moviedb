 * Represents different categories of TV shows.

 * This is a pure domain model with no infrastructure dependencies.
 * Following Clean Architecture - keeps domain independent of API details.

 * New categories can be added without modifying existing repository or ViewModel code.
 *
 * Mapping to infrastructure (e.g., TMDB API paths) is handled in the network layer.
